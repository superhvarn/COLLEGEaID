### How COLLEGEaiD Works...

The user registers, or signs into the account if an account is already created. The user is asked a series of questions ranging from their personality traits, academic information, finances, and others. On the basis of this, our AI recommends a set of Colleges best suited for students. 

This effectively gives universal access to information related to college planning and eases the process of college applications. Bridging the gap for people who can't afford expensive College Counsellors, this program effectively helps people through their over-strenuous planning for further studies
